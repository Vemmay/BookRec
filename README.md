# Cinetunes: A Song to Movie Recommendation App 

This web app was created for the class CS411: Software Engineering at Boston University. Our team’s webapp will have its users sign into their Spotify accounts to fetch the user’s top played songs. Our website will then fetch the top 10 movies that were released the year that the user’s top song was released — on the webpage, you will only see the movie posters for these movies. Clicking on the movie poster will take you to a separate page, where you can see the summary for the movie.

Our database also keeps track of the user’s previous top track and the year of its release.
